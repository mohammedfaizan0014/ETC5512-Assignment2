# About GeoPackages
GeoPackages contain data for Census geographical areas ranging from Statistical Area Level 1 to the whole of Australia. They include metadata and reference documents to enable you to use and read the data.

Metadata files contain the information you need to match the data with the Community Profile template, such as information about sequential numbers and labels, digital boundaries, table descriptors, and the population that is being counted. The Metadata folder also contains the geographical description file: 2016Census_geog_desc_1st_2nd_3rd_release.xlsx

GeoPackages do not include software.

# Using the GeoPackages
You can use GeoPackages if you:

•	want to use the data with your own database or analysis systems
•	want Community Profile data for numerous geographic areas.

# Descriptors

Short descriptors were created for use with Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Short descriptors (up to 29 characters) are available in the data. 
Should you require the long or sequential descriptors, you can find the corresponding information in the Metadata file contained in the zip file. For example the Metadata_2016_GCP_DataPack contains a listing of all sequential, short and long descriptor information. 

Some fields in GeoPackages have been modified from the original Census DataPack short headers to enable information grouping. For example Tot_Tot exists in different community profile tables (G26 & G28) within the GeoPackage SFC. To enable their coexistence in GeoPackage SFC, the fields have been renamed to Tot_Tot_G26 & Tot_Tot_G28. Included in each GeoPackage zip file is a DataPack_to_GeoPackage_Lookup csv file to enable referencing between the DataPack and GeoPackage metadata.


# GeoPackage Geographies

# Availability of geographic structures
The following tables show the availability of data for each geographic area, for the first, second and third releases.

Legend: 1 = GeoPackage first release data, 2 = GeoPackage second release data, 3 = GeoPackage third release data
Abbreviations for geographic structures are listed after the tables.

# Summary of Community Profiles

The community profiles are released in two phases. First release tables are those containing variables which are relatively easy to process and will be available on release day. Second release tables will contain variables which require more complex processing and will be available on the second release day.
Basis for counting people
•	'Place of usual residence' data counts people where they usually live.
•	'Place of enumeration' is the place at which the person is counted i.e. where he/she spent Census Night, which may not be where he/she usually lives. 
•	'Place of work' data provides information on where a person goes to work.

# Additivity of data
Please note that there are small random adjustments made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from the table totals.

# Templates
The templates provide an easy way for you to visualise all data cells available in the data files. They contain the formatted tables and the corresponding cell reference numbers. The templates are in the Metadata folder.

# Community Profile	Template
• GCP	2016_GCP_Sequential_Template.xlsx

# GeoPackage topics and mapping to Community Profiles

General Community Profile (GCP)
•	The GCP contains the Census characteristics on persons, families and dwellings.
•	The data is based on a combination place of usual residence and place of enumeration.
•	Tables G01-G39 were released on 12 July 2017. Tables G40-G59 were released on 10 November 2017.
